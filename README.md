✈️ Flight Data Analysis using SQL
📌 Overview
This project uses a simulated airline dataset to perform in-depth data analysis using SQL.
It demonstrates database design, data manipulation, and querying techniques to extract meaningful insights from structured data.

🛠 Features & Insights
🗄 Relational Database Schema: Airports, Airlines, Flights, Passengers, and Tickets.

🧠 Complex SQL Queries including:

JOINs

CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER)

Aggregations (COUNT, SUM, GROUP BY)

Conditional Logic (CASE)

📊 Analytical Outcomes:

Busiest airport by number of flights.

Tickets sold per airline.

Airline-specific flight listings (origin & destination).

Top airline for each airport.

Flight duration categorization (Short, Medium, Long).

Passenger travel history (first & last flights).

Highest-priced ticket per route.

Top-spending passenger per loyalty tier.
